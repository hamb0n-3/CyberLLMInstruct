    "G": "Keystroke logging, or keylogging, is a widely discussed concept in cyber security. It refers to the process of capturing each keystroke that a user types on a keyboard. This method can record sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and other inputs, making it a powerful but potentially dangerous tool. While commonly associated with malicious activities, keylogging has legitimate applications when used ethically in controlled environments. This essay explores keystroke logging, the types of keyloggers, and the ethical applications for learning purposes. To start, keystroke logging is a method of recording user input on a keyboard, with the potential to capture almost any kind of typed information. Keyloggers are often associated with malware and spyware due to their role in covert data theft. Once installed, keyloggers can capture everything a user types, from simple searches to confidential details, and often store the data locally or transmit it to an external server. For this reason, they are classified as invasive software in most jurisdictions and are heavily restricted under privacy laws.",
