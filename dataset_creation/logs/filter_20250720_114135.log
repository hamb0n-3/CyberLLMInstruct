It analyzes the resistance of these constructions to generic attacks, such as meet-in-the-middle attacks, and provides proofs that composition increases security. The study computes bounds on the probability of breaking these ciphers, showing that the success probability for double and two-key triple ciphers is the square of that for a single key cipher, with the bound being tight for the double cipher, indicating meet-in-the-middle is the best possible generic attack.",
